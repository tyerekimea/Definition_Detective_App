## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Ads Not Showing?

**Wait 24-48 hours**:
- AdSense needs time to fill inventory
- First ads may be blank or test ads
- Normal behavior!

**Check AdSense dashboard**:
- Are impressions being recorded?
- Any policy violations?
- Is site approved?

**Clear cache**:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or use incognito mode

### Still Seeing 400 Errors?

**Wait for deployment**:
- Changes take 2-3 minutes to deploy
- Check Vercel dashboard for status

**Clear browser cache**:
- Old code might be cached
- Hard refresh the page

**Check console**:
- Should see no errors after deployment
- If errors persist, let me know!

### Ads Showing But No Revenue?

**Wait 24-48 hours**:
- Revenue reporting has delay
- Check back tomorrow

**Check payment threshold**:
- Minimum: $100 for payment
- Accumulates over time

**Verify tracking**:
- AdSense dashboard shows impressions?
- Clicks being recorded?
