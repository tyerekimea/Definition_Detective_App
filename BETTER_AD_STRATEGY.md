# 🎯 Better Ad Strategy for Your Game

## ❌ Problem with Monetag

You're right - Monetag ads are too intrusive:
- Pop-ups and pop-unders
- Redirects
- Notification requests
- Interrupts gameplay
- Frustrates players
- Hurts retention

**Result**: Players leave, revenue drops long-term.

---

## ✅ Better Solution: User-Friendly Monetization

### Strategy 1: Google AdSense (Non-Intrusive)

**Why AdSense is better**:
- Professional, quality ads
- No pop-ups or redirects
- Respects user experience
- Higher revenue per impression
- Better for long-term growth

**Ad Placements** (Non-intrusive):
1. **Small banner at bottom** - Dismissible, doesn't block gameplay
2. **Between levels** - Natural break point
3. **On pricing page** - Users already thinking about money
4. **On profile page** - Viewing stats, not playing

**Revenue**: $5-20 per 1,000 views (vs Monetag's $1-5)

---

### Strategy 2: Rewarded Video Ads (Best UX!)

**How it works**:
```
Player runs out of hints
↓
"Watch a 30-second video for 3 free hints?"
↓
Player CHOOSES to watch
↓
Player gets hints, you get revenue
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Player chooses (not forced)
- ✅ Player gets value (hints/coins)
- ✅ Higher revenue ($10-50 per 1,000 views)
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Increases engagement

**Platforms**:
- Google AdMob (easiest)
- Unity Ads
- IronSource
- AppLovin

### Strategy 3: Premium Subscription (No Ads!)

**What you already have**:
- ₦2,000/month premium
- ₦20,000/year premium
- Hint packs
- Theme purchases

**Focus on conversions**:
- Make free version good (with ads)
- Make premium version amazing (no ads)
- 5-10% conversion is typical

**Revenue example**:
- 1,000 users
- 5% convert to premium (50 users)
- 50 × ₦2,000 = ₦100,000/month
- **Much better than ads!**

---

## 🎯 Recommended Hybrid Approach

### For Free Users:
1. **Small AdSense banner** at bottom (dismissible)
2. **Rewarded video ads** for hints (optional)
3. **Banner on pricing page** (already thinking about money)
4. **Banner on profile page** (not during gameplay)

### For Premium Users:
1. **Completely ad-free**
2. **Unlimited hints**
3. **Exclusive themes**
4. **Priority support**

### Result:
- Free users have good experience (minimal ads)
- Premium users have amazing experience (no ads)
- You maximize revenue from both groups
