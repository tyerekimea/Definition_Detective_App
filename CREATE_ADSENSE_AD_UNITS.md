# 🎯 How to Create AdSense Ad Units (Fix 400 Error)

## ❌ Current Problem

You're seeing this error:
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400
client=ca-pub-your_id
slotname=1234567890
```

**Why?** You're using placeholder ad slot IDs (`1234567890`) instead of real ones from AdSense.

## ✅ Solution: Create Real Ad Units

### Step 1: Go to AdSense Dashboard
Visit: **https://www.google.com/adsense/**

### Step 2: Navigate to Ads Section
1. Click **Ads** in the left sidebar
2. Click **By ad unit** tab
3. Click **Display ads** button

### Step 3: Create Your First Ad Unit

**For Game Over Ad**:
1. Click **Display ads**
2. Name: `Game Over Ad`
3. Ad type: **Responsive**
4. Click **Create**
5. **Copy the ad slot ID** (looks like: `1234567890`)

### Step 4: Create More Ad Units

Repeat for each location:

| Ad Unit Name | Location | Type |
|--------------|----------|------|
| Game Over Ad | After game ends | Responsive |
| Store Page Ad | Top of pricing page | Responsive |
| Profile Page Ad | Top of profile page | Responsive |

### Step 5: Update Your Code

Once you have real ad slot IDs, update `src/components/ads/AdManager.tsx`:

```typescript
const adConfig = {
  'game-over': {
    slot: 'YOUR_REAL_SLOT_ID', // Replace with actual ID from AdSense
    format: 'auto' as const
  },
  'store': {
    slot: 'YOUR_REAL_SLOT_ID', // Replace with actual ID from AdSense
    format: 'auto' as const
  },
  'profile': {
    slot: 'YOUR_REAL_SLOT_ID', // Replace with actual ID from AdSense
    format: 'auto' as const
  }
};
```

## 🔧 What I Fixed (Temporary)

Until you create real ad units, I've:

1. ✅ **Fixed client ID**: Changed from `ca-pub-your_id` to your real ID `ca-pub-2955575113938000`
2. ✅ **Added placeholder**: Shows "Ad space" message instead of 400 errors
3. ✅ **No more errors**: Console is clean now

### Current Behavior:

Instead of broken ads, you'll see:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Ad space - Create ad units  │
│ in AdSense dashboard        │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```
