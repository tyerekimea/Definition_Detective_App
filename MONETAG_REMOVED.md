## 📋 AdSense Ad Slots

Your AdSense ad slots (you'll need to create these in AdSense dashboard):

| Location | Ad Slot | Format |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Game Over | 1234567890 | Auto |
| Level Complete | 0987654321 | Horizontal |
| Store | 1122334455 | Auto |
| Sidebar | 5544332211 | Vertical |
| Profile | 6677889900 | Auto |

**Note**: These are placeholder slot IDs. You need to create actual ad units in your AdSense dashboard and replace these IDs.

## 🔧 How to Create AdSense Ad Units

### Step 1: Go to AdSense Dashboard
Visit: https://www.google.com/adsense/

### Step 2: Create Ad Units
1. Click **Ads** in sidebar
2. Click **By ad unit**
3. Click **Display ads**
4. Create ad units for each location:

   - "Store Page Ad" (Responsive)
   - "Profile Page Ad" (Responsive)

### Step 3: Get Ad Slot IDs
Copy the ad slot IDs (format: 1234567890)

### Step 4: Update AdManager.tsx
Replace the placeholder slot IDs with your real ones:

```typescript
const adConfig = {
  'game-over': {
    slot: 'YOUR_REAL_SLOT_ID', // Replace this
    format: 'auto' as const
  },
  // ... etc
};
```
